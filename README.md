# EIS_SUMER_PCH_Ti
---
A messy GitHub repository for my paper measuring ion temperatures at the polar coronal hole boundary region observed by Hinode/EIS and SOHO/SUMER. Some Jupyter notebooks use [my naive Python scripts](https://github.com/yjzhu-solar/MyPy).

Links to the Jupyter notebooks for each Figure:
