# EIS_SUMER_PCH_Ti
---
A messy GitHub repository for my paper measuring ion temperatures at the polar coronal hole boundary region observed by Hinode/EIS and SOHO/SUMER. Some Jupyter notebooks use [my naive Python scripts](https://github.com/yjzhu-solar/MyPy).

Links to the Jupyter notebooks for each Figure:

[Figure 1](/ipynb/check_eit_img.ipynb): Positions of the EIS and SUMER slits overplotted on SOHO/EIT 195 context images.

[Figure 2](/ipynb/eis_recalibrate_comp.ipynb): EIS onboard radiometric calibration curves from [Del Zanna et al. (2013)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2013A%26A...555A..47D/abstract) and [Warren et al. (2014)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2014ApJS..213...11W/abstract).
